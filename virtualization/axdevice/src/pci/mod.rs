//! Architecture-neutral virtual PCI Type-0 and ECAM foundation.
//!
//! The PCI root state (`root`) owns function config images, BAR decode,
//! bindings, and reset. Config frontends are separate runtime devices: the
//! ECAM device decodes its own window, and the memory-aperture device owns
//! the whole aperture. Both delegate already-typed accesses to one shared
//! root state, so config state and MMIO routing cannot diverge after the
//! frontends are registered in a sealed runtime.
//!
//! [`PciBusGraphBuilder`] derives the host windows and frozen PCI topology
//! from the same resolved device graph used for runtime claims. Endpoint BAR
//! handlers are constructed later and held by bundle-owned binding leases.
